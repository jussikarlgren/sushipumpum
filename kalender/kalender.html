Kalender - a configurable printable calendar
</h1>

Kalender is a perl script which will allow you to configure your own
wall calendar with images and your selection of holidays.  No
documentation (well, hardly any), no man page, write-only code.
Kalendar supports name days, birthdays, holidays, red days, flag days,
week numbers, and new and full moon.

<p>
Kalender runs in perl and produces html pages. To use kalender you
will need perl and a friendly web browser.

<h2>
Configuring kalender
</h2>


<h2>
Perl and how to run kalender
</h2>

Perl is freely downloadable from e.g. 
www.perl.org and relatively easy to install for
computer-literate users. 
Perl typically runs from a terminal
or MS-DOS window. 

<p>
Place the kalender code in a convenient directory
together with the files of birthdays etc
you wish to use.

<p>
Kalender is run by opening a terminal window,
going to the directory where kalender resides, and
giving the command "perl kalender". 
<h2>
Printing
</h2>

Try to use a web browser
which will allow you to print the pages without
page headers. 

<h2>
Configuration steps in brief
</h2>

First, modify the first bit of the kalendar code itself to
address the following points. 

<ol>
<li>
Year setup (Which year is it? What day of week does it begin?) 
<li>
European week or US week? (Sunday last or first day of week?)
<li>
Week numbers? 
<li>
One or two languages? (For month and weekday names?)
<li>
Names of weekdays and months?
<li>
Find 12 nice images and format them to fit the calendar page.
<li>
Page layout (Height and width of grid cells, etcetera?)
</ol>

Then, fix databases of special days to mark in the calendar in six
separate .kd files. Example files are provided together with the code.

<ul>
<li> Birthdays
<li> Namedays 
<li> Red days / Bank holidays / Observed holidays
<li> Other holidays or otherwise remarkable days
<li> Flag days
<li> Moon phases
</ul>
